 * \page recipe-iterate-over-grid Iterating over a grid
 *
 * A fundamental task in many finite element-type discretizations is iterating
 * over the elements of a grid, for example in order to numerically compute integrals
 * on it. All DUNE grids provide a unified interface for this and related operations.
 *
 * First, we set up a simple structured grid. Here we use the \ref Dune::YaspGrid class in
 * four dimensions in order to demonstrate that even dimension larger than three
 * can be used.
 * \snippet recipe-iterate-over-grid.cc set up grid
 *
 * Grids in Dune are hierachical, i.e. they are organized into levels
 * (originating from refinement) and entities that are not further refined.
 * Each of these subsets is accessible via Dune::GridView and iteration over
 * is possible only over grid views. So we extract the Dune::LeafGridView:
 * \snippet recipe-iterate-over-grid.cc extract gridview
 *
 * Now we can iterate over all the entities of a certain codimension in a grid view
 * using a range-based for loop:
 * \snippet recipe-iterate-over-grid.cc iterate over codim
 * As an example we extract the type of an element and test for it to be a cube.
 *
 * Instead of specifying the codimension explicitly you can also
 * use the following predefined names in the range-based for loop:
 * \snippet recipe-iterate-over-grid.cc iterate over grid view
 *
 * Finally, from entities of codimension 0 (aka elements) you can access
 * all subentities of all codimensions using the following code:
 * \snippet recipe-iterate-over-grid.cc access to subentities
 *
 * Full example code: @ref recipe-iterate-over-grid.cc
 * \example recipe-iterate-over-grid.cc
 * See explanation at @ref recipe-iterate-over-grid
