# Neighbours need not be specified, but if so, then the neighbourhood
# information should treat periodic faces as interior faces. We leave
# the neighbourhood information commented out such that it can be
# determined by the geometric face transformations.

# example for a torus:
# element neighbours:
#   5  1  7
#   0  4  2
#   7  3  1
#   2  6  4
#   1  5  3

#   3  7  5
#   6  2  0

# In principle it is possible to specify boundary types for periodic
# faces; those are ignored during "normal" operation, but can be
# accessed by using the special fill-flag FILL_NON_PERIODIC during
# mesh-traversal. This is primarily meant for defining parametric
# periodic meshes: the finite element function defining the mesh
# geometry is -- of course -- not periodic.

# For each face of the triangulation the number of the face

# per-element face transformations are computed.

# You will observe that there are "duplicate lines" below. Indeed, but
