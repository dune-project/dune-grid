       @brief Classes for reading a macrogrid file in the dune
       macrogrid format (dgf)

       @section General
       <!--=========-->
       The DGF format allows the simple description of macrogrids, which
       can be used to construct Dune grids independent of the underlying
       implementation. Due to the generality of the approach only a subset of
       the description language for each grid implementation is available through
       this interface.

       @section Usage
       <!---------------------------------------------->
       There are two ways of constructing Dune grids using DGF files:

       -# By defining one of the symbols
          \c ALBERTAGRID ,
          \c ALUGRID_CUBE ,
          \c ALUGRID_SIMPLEX ,
          \c ALUGRID_CONFORM ,
          \c UGGRID , or
          \c YASPGRID
          and the integer
          \c GRIDDIM
          one obtains a definition of the type \c GridType and
          the required header files for the desired grid and the macrogrid parser
          are included.
       -# By directly including one of the files dgf*.hh
          from the dune/grid/io/file/dgfparser directory: \n
          in this case only the required header files for the
          desired grid and the macrogrid parser are included but no typedef is made.

       After a grid type (denoted with \c GridType in the following)
       is selected in some way, the grid can be constructed either by calling

       @code
         Dune::GridPtr<GridType> gridptr(filename, mpiHelper.getCommunicator() );
       @endcode
        or
       @code
         Dune::GridPtr<GridType> gridptr(filename);
       @endcode
       or
       @code
         Dune::GridPtr<GridType> gridptr;
         ...
         gridptr=Dune::GridPtr<GridType>(filename);
       @endcode

       where in the second and third example \c MPIHelper::getCommunicator()
       is selected as default
       value; \c filename is the name of the dgf file. This creates an
       auto pointer like object \c Dune::GridPtr<GridType> holding a pointer to a
       the grid instance described through the dgf file.
       Access to the grid is gained by calling the operator * of \c GridPtr.
       @code
         GridType & grid = *gridptr;
       @endcode
       Like in all unique_ptr like objects the grid instance is destroyed
       if the GridPtr goes out of scope. To be able to destruct the GridPtr
       object without losing the grid call the release method:
       @code
         GridType *grid;
         {
           GridPtr< GridType > gridPtr( filename.c_str(), mpiHelper.getCommunicator() );
           grid = gridPtr.release();
         }
       @endcode

       Remarks:
       -# The last argument in the constructor of the GridPtr should be of the type \c Dune::MPIHelper::MPICommunicator
          which defaults to \c MPI_COMM_WORLD for parallel runs or some default value for serial runs.
       -# If the file given through the first argument is not a dgf file
          a suitable constructor on the \c GridType class is called - if
          one is available.

       @section FORMAT Format Description
       <!--=========-->
       We assume in the following that the type
       \c GridType  is suitably defined, denoting a dune grid type
       in \c dimworld  space dimension.
       A point in dimworld space is called a vector.

       In general dgf files consists of one or more blocks, each starting with a
       keyword and ending with a line starting with a # symbol.
       In a block each full line is parsed from the beginning up to the
       first occupance of a \% symbol, which can be used to include comments.
       Trailing whitespaces are ignored
       during line parsing. Also the parsing is not case sensitive.

       Some example files are given below (\ref EXAMPLES).

       @subsection START First line
       <!---------------------------------------------->
       DGF files must start with the keyword \b DGF. Files passed to the
       grid parser not starting with this keyword are directly passed to a
       suitable constructor in the GridType class.

       @subsection BLOCKS Blocks
       <!---------------------------------------------->
       In the following all blocks are briefly described in alphabetical order.
       The construction of the grid is detailed below. In general lines
       are parse sequentially, with the exception of lines starting
       with a special keyword which are treated separately.

       - \b Boundarydomain  \n
         Each line consists of an integer greater than zero and two
         vectors describing an interval in \c dimworld space. The first entry of
         the line is a boundary identifier.
         - A special keyword is
           \b default
           followed by a positive integer which is to be used
           as a default boundary identifier.
       - \b Boundarysegments \n
         Each line consists of a positive integer denoting a boundary
         id and a set of vertex indices (see \b Vertex block)
         describing one boundary patch of the macrogrid.
         Note that a special ordering of the vertex numbers is not required.
       - \b Cube  \n
         Each line consists of \c dimworld<SUP>2</SUP> vertex indices
         (see \b Vertex block) describing one cube
         of the macrogrid.
         - If the ordering of the local vertices of the cube elements
           does not follow the %Dune
           @link GeometryReferenceElements reference element@endlink then
           the mapping between the local numbering used and the dune reference
           cube has to be prescribed by a line starting with the keyword \b map
           followed by the permutation of the numbers
           \c 0...2<SUP>dimworld</SUP> describing the mapping from the
           local vertex numbers in the reference elements used in the dgf file
           to the local vertex numbers in dune reference element.
         - By means of the special keyword \b parameters followed by a positive
           integer \c n it is possible to add \c n parameters to each element of the
           grid. These double valued parameters then have to be added to the definition
           lines for the elements behind the vertex numbers.
       - \b Interval \n
         Each interval is described by three lines in this block:
         the first two lines give the lower and upper vector of an interval,
         the third line consists of \c dimworld integers. used to determine the
         initial partition of the interval into equal sized cubes.
         More than one interval can be described in this fashion.
         Optional a reordering of the i-j-k logic can be added as a first line
         of the Interval block. The reordering is indicated by the keyword map
         followed by the permutation of the coordinates {0,...,d}
         (which is the default ordering).
       - \b Simplex \n
         Each line consists of \c dimworld+1 vertex indices (see \b Vertex block)
         describing one simplex
         of the macrogrid.
         - Note that no ordering of local vertices is required.
         - Parameters can be added to each element using the \b parameters keyword
           as described for cube elements.
       - \b Simplexgenerator \n
         Using this block a simplex grid can be automatically generated using
         one of the freely available grid generation tools
         Tetgen (http://tetgen.org) for \c dimworld=3 or
         Triangle (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) for \c dimworld=2.
         For more detail see \ref Simplexgeneration.
       - \b Vertex \n
         Each line consists of a vector representing a vertex of the
         macrogrid. The vertices are consecutively numbered.
         leading to vertex indices which can be referenced in the
         \b Simplex, \b Cube, and \b Boundarysegment blocks.
         - By default the numbering starts from zero; to change this behaviour
           the keyword
           \b firstindex followed by a positive integer denoting the number
           of the first vertex can be used.
         - Using the \b parameters keyword it is possible to add a set of parameters
           to each vertex of the grid.
       - \b GridParameter \n
         For each grid implementation there is a set of parameters
         that can be passed via the GridParameter block to the momment of
         grid construction. For the specific parameters see the \ref
         DGFGridParameter section. See also the \b examplegrid5.dgf file
         for examples.
       - \b PeriodicFaceTransformation \n
         Each line describes an affine transformation that shall be used to
         glue grid boundaries together. The transformation is denoted as
         \em matrix + \em shift. The following 2d example describes a shift by
         the first unit vector:
         \code
     1 0, 0 1 + 1 0
         \endcode
       - \b Projection \n
         Each line either declares a function or it assigns one a boundary segment.
         Functions are declared as follows:\n
         <b>function</b> <em>function</em> <b>(</b> <em>variable</em> <b>)</b> <b>=</b> <em>expression</em>\n
         The following expressions are currently implemented:
         - <em>constant</em>
         - <em>variable</em>
         - <b>(</b> <em>expression</em> <b>)</b>
         - <em>function</em> <b>(</b> <em>expression</em> <b>)</b>
         - <em>expression</em> <b>[</b> <em>constant</em> <b>]</b>
         - <b>-</b> <em>expression</em>
         - <b>|</b> <em>expression</em> <b>|</b>
         - <em>expression</em> <b>+</b> <em>expression</em>
         - <em>expression</em> <b>-</b> <em>expression</em>
         - <em>expression</em> <b>*</b> <em>expression</em>
         - <em>expression</em> <b>/</b> <em>expression</em>
         - <em>expression</em> <b>**</b> <em>expression</em>
         - <b>sqrt</b> <em>expression</em>
         - <b>sin</b> <em>expression</em>
         - <b>cos</b> <em>expression</em>
         .
         Functions are assigned to boundary segments as follows:\n
         <b>segment</b> <em>vertex</em> ... <em>vertex</em> <em>function</em>\n
         Here, the given vertices identify the boundary segment.\n
         Another possibility is to set a default, assigned to all non-listed
         boundary segments:\n
         <b>default</b> <em>function</em>\n
         Note: Currently, the attached functions map global coordinates to global
               coordinates. This feature is only available with AlbertaGrid or
               with dune-ALUGrid.
       .

       @section CONSTR The Grid Construction Process
       <!---------------------------------------------->
       For simplicity we first describe how the grid is manually constructed,
       i.e., if no \b Simplexgenerator  block is found. Details on how
       Tetgen/Triangle can be used is detailed below (see \ref Simplexgeneration).
       How to access the element and vertex parameter is detailed in
       Section \ref PARAMETERS.
       The details of the construction are logged in the file
       \b dgfparser.log.

       The construction of the grid depends on the type of elements the
       given by \c GridType can handle.

       @subsection CONSTRCART Cartesian grids
       (Dune::YaspGrid )

       The grid is constructed using only the information from the
       first three lines of the \b Interval  block.

       @subsection CONSTRSIMPL Simplex grids
       (Dune::AlbertaGrid, or
        Dune::ALUGrid<3,3,simplex,nonconforming>, and
        Dune::ALUGrid<2,2,simplex,nonconforming>)

       The vertices and elements of the grid are constructed in the
       following three steps:
       -# The file is parsed for
          an \b Interval  block; if present a Cartesian grid is build for each
          interval defined in this block and
          each element is partitioned either into two triangles or into six
          tetrahedron. The user has to make sure that this process leads to
          a conforming grid.
       -# If no \b Interval
          block is found, the grid is generated using the information
          from the \b Vertex and the \b Simplex or \b Cube  blocks.
          If a non-empty \b Simplex block is found the element information is
          only taken from there; in the case where no \b Simplex block is found
          or in the case where it is empty, the \b Cube block is read and each
          cube is partitioned into simplex elements - in 3d this process will
          not always lead to a correct macro triangulation!
          Note that no specific ordering of the local numbering of each simplex
          is required but the cubes must either conform with the Dune reference
          element or the mapping must be prescribed using the map keyword.
       .
       If the simplex generation process was successful, boundary ids are
       assigned to all boundary faces of the macrogrid.
       -# If the macrogrid was constructed in the third step of the generation
          process detailed above (i.e. using the vertex block),
          then the file is first parsed for
          \b Boundarysegment  block. Here boundary ids can be
          individually assigned to each boundary segment of the macrogrid
          by specifying the vertex ids. Boundary segments can either be described
          as simplex elements or as cube elements.
       -# All Boundary segments which have not
          yet been assigned an identifier and lie inside the
          interval defined by the first line of the \b Boundarydomain
          block are assigned the corresponding id. This process is then
          repeated with the remaining boundary segments using the following
          intervals defined in the \b Boundarydomain  block.
          If after this process boundary segments without id remain,
          then the default id is used if one was specified in the
          \b Boundarydomain  block - if no default was given, the
          behavior of the parser is not well defined.
       .
       \b Remark:
       -# \c Bisection: \n
          the refinement edge is always chosen to be the longest edge.

       @subsection CONSTRCUBE Cube grids
       (Dune::ALUGrid<3,3,cube,nonconforming>)

       The grid is constructed using the information from the
       \b Interval  block, if present; otherwise the \b Vertex and \b Cube
       blocks are used.

       The boundary ids are assigned in the same manner as for simplex grids
       described above.

       @subsection CONSTRMIXED Mixed grids
       (\c Dune::UGGrid )

       Note that in this version only grids consisting of one element type are
       constructed even if the implemented grid allows for mixed elements.

       The vertices and elements of the grid are constructed in one of the
       following stages:
       -# The file is first parsed for
          an \b Interval  block; if present a Cartesian grid is build;
          a simplex grid is generated if a \c Simplex block is present
          otherwise a cube grid is constructed.
       -# If no \b Interval
          block is found, the grid is generated using the information
          from the \b Vertex block; cube elements are constructed if the
          \b Cube block is present otherwise the \b Simplex blocks is read.
          If both a \b Cube and a \b Simplex block is found, then only
          the element information from the \b Cube block is used and each
          cube is split into simplex elements so that
          a simplex grid is constructed.
       .
       Boundary ids are assigned in the same manner as described for
       simplex grids.

       @section PARAMETERS Accessing parameters
       In addition to the element and vertex information it is possible to add
       a set of parameters through the DGF file. Using the construction
       mechanism via the Dune::GridPtr<GridType> class these parameters can be
       accessed using the
       Dune::GridPtr<GridType>::parameters(const Entity& en)
       method. Depending on the codimentsion of \c en the method returns either
       the element or vertex parameters of that entity in the DGF file.
       The number of parameters for a given
       codimension can be retrived using the method
       Dune::GridPtr<GridType>::nofParameters.
       In the case of parallel runs only the process with rank zero reads the
       dgf file and thus the parameters are only available on that processor.
       Do not call loadBalance (or for that matter globalRefine, adapt) on the
       grid instance before retrieving the parameters. To simplify the handling
       of parameters in a parallel run the Dune::GridPtr<GridType>::loadBalance
       method can be used to distribute the macro grid and the parameters.
       Afterwards the parameters can be extracted on each processor using the
       method GridPtr<GridType>::parameters.

      <!---------------------------------------------->
     \section Simplexgeneration Using Tetgen/Triangle
         The freely available simplex grid generators are directly
         called via system
         call through the dgfparser.
         Therefore one should either add the path containing the executables of
         Triangle and/or Tetgen to the environment variable PATH or use the path
         option described below.
         One can either use a file in Tetgen/Triangle format to directly generate
         a macro grid or one can prescribe vertices and boundary faces
         which will be used to generate the grid directly in the DGF file:
         -# For the first approach use the token \b file to give a filename
            and the type of the file (e.g. node, mesh, ply...). Example:
            \code
              file name mesh
            \endcode
            If the filetype is given, it will be appended to \b name and this will be
            passed to Tetgen/Triangle. Additional parameters for the grid generators
            can be given by the \b parameter token.
            If no file type is given it is assumed that in a previous run of
            Tetgen/Triangle
            files name.node and name.ele were generated and these will be used
            to describe the vertices and elements of the Dune grid.
         -# In the second approach the \b vertex and the \b interval blocks
            (if present)
            are used to generate the vertices of the grid; the \b Cube and \b
            Simplex blocks are used for element information in the interior and
            the \b boundarysegment block is used for boundary information:
            - If only a \b vertex and/or \b interval block is found
              the resulting .node file is passed directly to Tetgen/Triangle and a
              tessellation of
              the convex hull of the points is generated.
            - A more detailed
              description of the domain is possible by using the \b
              Boundarysegment block together with the \b vertex block.
              Planar polyhedral boundary faces of the domain can be
              prescribed in this way.
              Note that in this case the whole
              domain boundary has to be defined (see the description of
              the .poly files in the Tetgen documentation).
              In 3d each polyhedral face (p0,..,pn) is automatically closed by adding
              the segment between p0 and pn. To define the whole boundary
              of a 2d domain using only one polyhedron the closing
              segment has to be added, i.e., (p0,..,pn,p0).
            - If a \b cube or \b simplex block is found the element information
              is also passed to tetgen/triangle together with the parameters - if
              given. Note that a triangle can only handle one region attribute in
              its .poly files so that only the first parameter is the \b simplex
              or \b cube block can be retrived.
         .

         Some identifiers can be
         used to influence the quality of the generated mesh:
         -  \b max-area
            followed by a positive real number used as an upper bound for the
            area of all simplicies of the mesh.
         -  \b min-angle
            followed by a positive number. In 2d this limits the angles in the
            resulting mesh from below; in 3d this bounds the radius-edge ratio
            from above.
         .
         In this case the grid is constructed using two calls to Tetgen/Triangle.           The details of the call are logged in the \b dgfparser.log file.

        \e Note: vertex parameters are interpolated in triangle but tetgen
                  assigns a zero to all newly inserted vertices; therfore quality
                  enhancement and vertex parameters should not be combined in 3d.
                  On the other hand element parameters and boundary ids can be
                  used together with quality enhancement.


         The remaining identifiers are
         -  The identifier \b path
            (followed by a path name) can be used
            to give a search path for Triangle/Tetgen.
         -  The identifier \b display
            followed by 1 can be used to get a first impression
            of the resulting mesh using the visualization tools distributed with
            Triangle/Tetgen.
         .
         \e Note that parameters can be attached to the vertices and elements of
         the grid as described in the Triangle/Tetgen manual. Then can be
         retrieved as described in Section \ref PARAMETERS.

     @section OPEN Work in progress
     -# There should be a mechanism to fix the desired refinement edge
        for simplex grids. An automatic selection is performed using the
        longest edge, but
        it should be possible to turn off this automatic selection.
     -# A callback to the user
        between parsing the DGF file and the construction of the dune grid;
        here e.g. a post-processing of the vertex coordinates could be included.

     \section dgfexample1 Manual Grid Construction
     A tessellation of the unit square into six simplex entities.
     Some boundary segments on the lower and right
     boundary are given their own id the remaining are
     given a default id.

     A tessellation into cubes using the same vertices as before,

     @include examplegrid1c.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid1c.png "The resulting grid"

     Using the last input file with a simplex grid or by adding an empty
     \c Simplex block
     @code
     Simplex
   #
     @endcode
     leads to the following macro triangulation

     \image html  examplegrid1cs.png "The resulting grid"

     \section dgfexample2 Automated Grid Construction
     Automatic tessellation using Triangle,
     with vertices defined as in the example \ref dgfexample1 :

     @include examplegrid1gen.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid1gen.png "The resulting grid"

     The quality of the grid can be enhanced by adding the line
     @code
     min-angle 30
     @endcode
     in the \c Simplexgenerator block

     \image html  examplegrid1genangle.png "The resulting grid"

     Automatic tessellation using Triangle,
     with vertices are defined on a Cartesian grid with two additional
     vertices in the top right corner and one vertex outside the unit square.

     All boundary are given a default id.

     @include examplegrid2a.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid2a.png "The resulting grid"

     Adding some quality enhancement.
     The boundaries are numbered counterclockwise starting at the left
     boundary from one to four.

     @include examplegrid2b.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid2b.png "The resulting grid"

     Using both quality enhancement and a maximum area restriction.
     The bottom boundary is given the id 1 all other boundaries have
     id 2; here we do not use a default value.

     @include examplegrid2c.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid2c.png "The resulting grid"

     A similar grid is generated by prescribing the boundary of the domain:

     @include examplegrid2d.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid2d.png "The resulting grid"

     \section dgfexampleParam Using Parameters

     We use the same domain as in the previous example but include vertex and
     element parameters:

     @include examplegrid2e.dgf

     The results in piecewise constant data on the elements and piecewise linear
     date using the vertex parameters:

     \image html  examplegrid2e.png "The resulting grid with element and vertex parameters"

     \section dgfexample3 Interval Domain
     A automatic tessellation of the unit square using
     a Cartesian Grid.
     All boundaries have id 1.

     @include examplegrid5.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid5c.png "The resulting grid using YaspGrid<2>"
     \image html  examplegrid5s.png "The resulting grid using AlbertaGrid<2,2>"

     If UGGrid<2,2> is used the result would be the same as for YaspGrid<2>.
     If an empty \c Simplex Block
     @code
     Simplex
   #
     @endcode
     is added than the same simplex grid as for AlbertaGrid<2,2> would be
     constructed.

       <!---------------------------------------------->
     \section dgfexample6 Boundary Projections
     The following example shows a DGF file that projects 3 sides of a
     quadrilateral onto the surrounding circle:
     @include example-projection.dgf

     \image html  example-projection.png "The resulting grid using AlbertaGrid<2>"

       <!---------------------------------------------->
     \section dgfexample4 Grid Generation in 3d
     An automatic tessellation of the unit square using
     a Cartesian Grid is shown.
     All boundaries have id 1 except boundary segment on the lower boundary
     which have value 2.

     First we use only the interval block:

     @include examplegrid6.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid6c.png "The resulting grid using ALUGrid<3,3,cube,nonconforming>"
     \image html  examplegrid6s.png "The resulting grid using ALUGrid<3,3,simplex,nonconforming>"

     Now the vertices are still defined through the interval block; the simplicies
     are constructed using Tetgen (note the comment symbol \% in the
     \b Simplexgenerator block):

     @include examplegrid7.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid7.png "The resulting grid using ALUGrid<3,3,simplex,nonconforming>"

     Note that in the grid would be the same as in the above example if
     ALUGrid<3,3,cube,nonconforming> where used.

     Now we can also include some quality enhancement:

     First: \b min-angle = 1.2
            (remove the first \% in the \b Simplexgenerator block)
     \image html  examplegrid7angle.png "The resulting grid using ALUGrid<3,3,simplex,nonconforming>"

     Second: \b min-angle = 1.2 and \b max-area = 0.1
             (remove both \% in the \b Simplexgenerator block)
     \image html  examplegrid7area.png "The resulting grid using ALUGrid<3,3,simplex,nonconforming>"
       <!---------------------------------------------->

     This examples show different ways to define a grid for the following
     domain and boundary ids:
     \image html  examplegrid10.png "An example domain"

     \e Manual grid construction: Note that the reference element used
     to define the cube is not the one used in dune so that the
     mapping has to be given; furthermore the vertex index are numbered
     starting with 1.
     If a simplex grid is to be constructed
     some care must be taken in the numbering of the nodes so that a
     conforming grid is constructed.

     @include examplegrid10.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid10c.png "The resulting cube grid"
     \image html  examplegrid10s.png "The resulting simplex grid"

     \e Using multiple intervals: Here the boundary ids are not set
     correctly; this could be done using different boundarydomains.

     @include examplegrid11.dgf

     \image html  examplegrid11a.png "The resulting cube grid"
     \image html  examplegrid11b.png "The resulting simplex grid"

     \e By only defining the boundary faces and using Tetgen:

     @include examplegrid12.dgf

     Without the \b max-area and \b min-angle keywords the following
     grid is constructed:

     \image html  examplegrid12_1.png "The resulting grid"

     With the quality enhancement active:

     \image html  examplegrid12_2.png "The resulting grid"

     Finally we demonstrate the use of parameters. With a simple modification
     of the above example

     @include examplegrid10a.dgf

     we can define parameters on each element:

     \image html  examplegrid10a.png "The resulting grid with element parameters"

     The following example

     @include examplegrid10b.dgf

     defines parameters for each vertex of the grid, leading to a piecewise linear
     function
