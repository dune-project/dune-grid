  /** \brief Specialization of the generic GridFactory for UGGrid

      \ingroup GridFactory

     <p>
     If you want to write a routine that reads a grid from some
     file into a Dune UGGrid object you have to know how to use the UGGrid
     grid factory.  In the following we
     assume that you have a grid in some file format and an
     empty UGGrid object, created by one of its constructors.
     Hence, your file reader method signature may look like this:
     </p>

     <pre>
     UGGrid&lt;3&gt;* readMyFileFormat(const std::string& filename)
     </pre>

     Now, in order to create a valid UGGrid object do the
     following steps:

     <h2> 1) Create a GridFactory Object </h2>
     <p>
     Get a new GridFactory object by calling
     <pre>
     GridFactory<UGGrid<dim> > factory;
     </pre>

     <h2> 2)  Enter the Vertices </h2>

     <p>
     Insert the grid vertices by calling
     </p>

     <pre>
     factory.insertVertex(const FieldVector&lt;double,dimworld&gt;& position);
     </pre>

     <p>
     for each vertex.  The order of insertion determines the level- and leaf indices
     of your level 0 vertices.
     </p>


     <h2> 3) Enter the elements </h2>

     <p>
     For each element call
     </p>

     <pre>
     factory.insertElement(Dune::GeometryType type, const std::vector&lt;int&gt;& vertices);
     </pre>

     <p>
     The parameters are
     </p>

     <ul>
     <li> <b>type</b> - The element type.  UG supports the types <i>simplex</i> and
     <i>cube</i> in 2d, and <i>simplex, cube, prism</i>, and <i>pyramid</i> in 3d.
     <li> <b>vertices</b> - The Ids of the vertices of this element.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>
     The numbering of the vertices of each element is expected to follow the DUNE conventions.
     Refer to the page on reference elements for the details.

     <h2> 4) Parametrized Domains </h2>

     <p>
     UGGrid supports parametrized domains.  That means that you can provide a
     smooth description of your grid boundary.  The actual grid will always
     be piecewise linear; however, as you refine, the grid will approach your
     prescribed boundary.  You don't have to do this.  If your
     coarse grid boundary describes your domain well read on at Section 5.
     </p>

     <p>
     In order to create curved boundary segments, for each segment you have to write
     a class which implements the correct geometry.  These classes are then handed
     over to the UGGrid object.  Boundary segment implementations must be derived
     from
     <pre>
     template &lt;int dimworld&gt; Dune::BoundarySegment
     </pre>
     This is an abstract base class which requires you to overload the method

     <pre>
     virtual FieldVector&lt; double, dimworld &gt; operator() (const FieldVector&lt; double, dimworld-1 &gt; &local)
     </pre>

     <p>
     This methods must compute the world coordinates from the local ones on the
     boundary segment.  Give these classes to your grid factory by calling
     </p>
     <pre>
     factory.insertBoundarySegment(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;& vertices,
                             const BoundarySegment&lt;dimworld&gt; *boundarySegment);
     </pre>

     <p>
     Control over the allocated objects is taken from you, and the grid object
     will take care of their destruction.
     </p>

     <h2> 5) Finish construction </h2>

     <p>
     To finish off the construction of the UGGrid object call
     </p>

     <pre>
     UGGrid<dim>* grid = factory.createGrid();
     </pre>

     <p>
     This time it is you who gets full responsibility for the allocated object.
     </p>

     <h2> Loading a Grid on a Parallel Machine </h2>
     <p>
     If you're working on a parallel machine, and you want to set up a
     parallel grid, proceed as described only on the rank-0 process.
     On the other processes just create a GridFactory and call createGrid()
     to obtain the grid object. This will create the grid on the master process
     and set up UG correctly on all other process.  Call <tt>loadBalance()</tt>
     to actually distribute the grid.
     </p>

     <p>\warning To use a parametrized boundary on a parallel machine you need
     to hand over the boundary segments to the grid factory on <b>all</b> processes.
     This behavior violates the Dune grid interface specification and will be
     corrected in the future.
     </p>
