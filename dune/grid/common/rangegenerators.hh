   * \addtogroup GIIteration
   * \brief Iterator ranges for entities and intersections to support iteration with range-based for loops.
   *
   * Iterating over sets of entities or intersections is one of the most common operations when
   * writing DUNE code. The grid interface implements this in the standard C++ ways by providing
   * iterators and matching begin() and end() methods, but their usage can be rather unwieldy.
   *
   * This page describes a much simpler alternative based on a C++11 feature called range-based for loop.
   *
   * <h2>Range-based for loop</h2>
   *
   * A range-based for loop is a short-hand way of iterating over any object that provides the standard
   * begin() and end() methods. It looks like this:
   *
     \code
     for (auto& i : vec)
       i *= 2;
     \endcode
   *
   * This code will multiply all entries of `vec` by 2. The loop head always looks like `for (<type> <variable-name> : <container>)`.
   * You can also specify the exact type of the variable, but it is normally much easier to let the compiler
   * do that for you using `auto`.
   *
   * \note We are aware that people like Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb
   *       Sutter advertise the use `auto&&`. Sadly GCC prior to version 6 has a bug (see
   *       https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=63506), which
   *       prevents the use of `auto&&` in template functions. For this reason
   *       we currently advice the use of `const auto&`.
   *
   * For those interested in the technical details, the compiler has translated the loop into
   * something resembling this (not quite, but we'll forget about the minor details here):
   *
     \code
     for (auto it = vec.begin(),
            end = vec.end();
          it != end;
          ++it)
     {
       auto& i = *it;
       i *= 2;
     }
     \endcode
   *
   * For further details, see e.g. http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for.
   *
   * <h2>Entities</h2>
   *
   * You cannot simply iterate over all entities of a GridView by passing it to a range-based for loop,
   * simply because you cannot (and probably do not want to) iterator over *all* of its entities. Instead,
   * algorithms typically have to iterate over all entities with a particular codimension, e.g. over all
   * grid cells. The functions listed at the top of this page allow you to do just this. Assuming you have
   * a GridView `gv`, you can iterate over its cells and vertices like this:
   *
     \code
     // iterate over cells
     for (const auto& cell : elements(gv))
     {
       std::cout << "Cell " << gv.indexSet().index(cell) << " is centered at "
                 << cell.geometry().center() << std::endl;
     }
     // iterate over vertices
     for (const auto& vertex : vertices(gv))
     {
       std::cout << "Vertex " << gv.indexSet().index(vertex) << " at "
                 << vertex.geometry().center() << std::endl;
     }
     \endcode
   *
   * \note As explained above, **always** use `const auto&` for the type of the Entity!
   *
   * There are also functions for iterating over facets() and edges() as well as generic entities() functions,
   * which allow you to specify a numeric codimension or dimension.
   *
   * If you are using Dune for parallel computations, you probably know that the GridView offers iterators with
   * different \link PartitionIteratorType PartitionIteratorTypes\endlink. Those are also supported with range-based
   * for loops: By default, the functions above will iterate over all entities (Dune::All_Partition), but they
   * accept an additional parameter for selecting a different set of partitions. This parameter is of type
   * Dune::PartitionSet. You can find pre-instantiated objects for all partitions and allowed combinations in the
   * namespace Dune::Partitions. Using those objects, you can iterate over all interior and border vertices like
   * this:
   *
     \code
     // use prebuild PartitionSet
     for (const auto& vertex : vertices(gv,Dune::Partitions::interiorBorder))
     {
        ...
     }
     // construct PartitionSet by combining partitions
     for (const auto& vertex : vertices(gv,Dune::Partitions::interior + Dune::Partitions::border))
     {
        ...
     }
     \endcode
   *
   * <h2>Intersections</h2>
   *
   * If you want to iterate over the \link Intersection intersections \endlink of an Entity, you can
   * use the function intersections() to obtain a range that is suitable for a range-based for loop.
   * Intersections are always defined with respect to a GridView; for further information, see the discussion
   * on locally refined grids.
   *
   * As an example, the following code counts the number of boundary intersections for a given GridView `gv`:
   *
   * \code
     std::size_t count = 0;
     for (const auto& e : elements(gv))
     {
       do_stuff();
       for (const auto& i : intersections(gv,e))
       {
         if (e.boundary())
           ++count;
       }
     }
     \endcode
   *
   * <h1>Information for grid implementors</h1>
   *
   * <h2>Custom range implementations</h2>
   *
   * The default implementation of the range generator functions calls the correct begin() and end()
   * methods on the GridView / the Entity and stores the iterators returned by these methods in an
   * IteratorRange object which is then returned by value (as a temporary object). While any overhead
   * associated with this process will normally be negligible compared with the ensuing grid traversal,
   * you can guarantee optimal performance by making sure that your iterators are move-constructible and
   * move-assignable.
   * If, for some reason, you don't want to rely on this default implementation, you only have to provide
   * an overload for the function `entities(const GV&, Dune::Codim<cd>, Dune::PartitionSet<ps>)`. All
   * other functions simply forward to this single function. Apart from that, you will of course have
   * to overload `intersections()` and `descendantElements()` as well - those are entirely separate.
   *
   * <h2>ADL lookup for grids in non-standard namespaces</h2>
   *
   * The range generator functions described on this page are found by means of argument-dependent
   * lookup (ADL). That way, users don't have to explicitly specify the namespace when using those
   * functions.
   *
   * Making ADL work does however require some care from grid implementors who are developing grids
   * which are not placed in the namespace `Dune`. More precisely, the GridView and the Entity classes
   * have to be in that namespace. If you are using the default facade classes, you don't have to worry
   * about this fact (the facade classes are in the correct namespace), but if your implementation
   * does not use those facades, you will have to import the functions on this page into the namespace
   * of your GridView and / or Entity classes to make ADL work:
   *
   * \code
     namespace MyAweSomeGrid {

       using Dune::entities;
       using Dune::elements;
       using Dune::facets;
       using Dune::edges;
       using Dune::vertices;
       using Dune::descendantElements;
       using Dune::intersections;

       ...

     }
     \endcode
   *
   * Of course, you can also reimplement all functions in your own namespace, but that's probably
   * a bad idea...
   *
