         @addtogroup Grid Grid

         The Dune Grid module defines a general interface to a parallel, in general
     nonconforming, locally refined and hierarchical
         finite element mesh.  The interface is independent of dimension and
         element type.

         @section Grid1 Terminology


         @subsection subs1 Entity

         An entity is a geometric object that is part of a grid. It is
     generalized polytope that has the same dimensionality as the grid
     or a lower dimension.


         @subsection subs20 Dimension

         A grid has a fixed dimension \f$d\f$ which is the number of coordinates
     required to specify any point in the grid. The dimension is a template parameter
     of a grid.


         @subsection subs21 Codimension of an entity

         Each entity has a codimension \f$c\f$ where \f$0 \leq c \leq d\f$ (the dimension of the grid).
         An entity with codimension \f$ c\f$ in a grid of dimension \f$ d\f$ is a \f$d-c\f$-dimensional
         object.


         @subsection subs5 Subentity

         Entities are hierarchically constructed in the sense that entities of
         codimension 0 are made up of entities of codimension 1 which are themselves
         made up of entities of codimension 2 etc. until entities of codimension \f$d-1\f$
         which consist of entities of codimension \f$ d\f$.


         @subsection subs3 Element

         An element is an entity of codimension 0.


         @subsection subs4 Vertex

         A vertex is an entity of codimension \f$ d\f$ (the same as the grid's dimension).


         @subsection subs22 World dimension

         Each grid has a world dimension \f$ w\f$ with \f$ w\geq d\f$. This is the number
     of coordinates of the positions of the grid's vertices.


         @subsection subs33 Hierarchical grid

         The %Dune grid interface describes not only a single grid but a sequence of
         grids with different resolution. This is achieved by beginning with an
         intentionally coarse grid, the so-called macro grid. Then each
     element may be individually subdivided to yield new (smaller) elements.
         This construction is recursive such that each macro element and
         all the elements that resulted from subdividing it form a tree structure.

         @subsection subs33333 Grid refinement

         The grid can only be modified in special phases, the so-called refinement phase.
         In between refinement phases the entities of the grid can not be modified in any way.
         During refinement currently only the hierachic subdivision can be modified.


         @subsection subs3333 Grid level

         All elements of the macro grid form level 0 of the grid structure. All
         elements that are obtained from an \f$ l\f$-fold subdivision of a macro
         element form level \f$ l\f$ of the grid structure.

         @subsection subs333 Leaf grid

         All elements of a grid that are not subdivided any further make up
         the leaf grid. The leaf grid is the mesh with the finest resolution.

         @subsection subs6 Assignable

         A type is said to be assignable if it has a (public) copy constructor and
         assignment operator. Note that this definition requires always both methods.


         @subsection subs7 Default-constructible

         A type is said to be default-constructible if it has a constructor without arguments.


         @subsection subs8 Copy-constructible from type X

         A type is said to be copy constructible from some other type X if it has
         a copy constructor that takes a reference to an object of type X.


         @subsection subs9 Equality-comparable

         A type is said to be equality-comparable if it has an operator==.


         @subsection subs10 LessThan-comparable

         A type is lessthan-comparable if it has an operator<.


         @subsection subs11 Dereferenceable

         A type is dereferenceable if it has an operator* that delivers
         a reference to a value type.

         @subsection subs11 Iterator

         An iterator is a type that can be dereferenced to yield an object of
         its value type, i.e. it behaves like a pointer, and that can be incremented to
         point to the next element in a linear sequence. In that respect it is comparable to
         ForwardIterator in the Standard Template Library.


         @subsection subs12 Mutable iterator

         An iterator is called mutable if the value it refers to can be changed, i.e. it is
         assignable.


         @subsection subs13 Immutable iterator

         An iterator is called immutable if the value referenced by the iterator can not
         be changed, i. e. the value is not assignable and only methods marked const on the value
         can be called.


         @subsection subs14 Model

         A type M is called a model of another type X if it implements all the methods
         of X with the intended semantics. Typically X is a type that describes an interface.


         @section Grid3 Types common to all grid implementations

         - Dune::ReferenceElement describes the topology and geometry of standard entities.
         Any given entity of the grid can be completely specified by a reference element
         and a map from this reference element to world coordinate space.

         - Dune::GeometryType defines names for the reference elements.

         - Dune::CollectiveCommunication defines an interface to global communication
         operations in a portable and transparent way. In particular also for sequential grids.



         @section Grid2 Types making up a grid implementation

     Each implementation of the Dune grid interface consist of a number of related types which
         together form a model of the grid interface. These types are the following:

         - %Grid which is a model of Dune::Grid where the template parameters are at least the
         dimension and the world dimension. It is a container of entities that allows to access
         these entities and that knows the number of entities.

         - %Entity which is a model of Dune::Entity. This class is parametrized by dimension and
         codimension. The entity encapsulates the topological part of an entity, i.e. its hierarchical
         construction from subentities and the relation to other entities. Entities cannot
         be created, copied or modified by the user. They can only be read-accessed through
         immutable iterators.

         - %Geometry which is a model of Dune::Geometry. This class encapsulates the geometric part
         of an entity by mapping local coordinates in a reference element to world coordinates.

         - %LevelIterator which is a model of Dune::LevelIterator is an immutable iterator
     that provides access to all entities of a given codimension and level of the
         grid.
         - %LeafIterator which is a model of Dune::LeafIterator is an immutable iterator
         that provides access to all entities of a given codimension of the leaf grid.

         - %HierarchicIterator which is a model of Dune::HierarchicIterator is an immutable
         iterator that provides access to all entities of codimension 0 that resulted from subdivision
         of a given entity of codimension 0.

         - %Intersection which is a model of Dune::Intersection
         provides access an intersection of codimension 1 of two entity of codimension 0
     or one entity and the boundary. In a conforming mesh this
         is a face of an element. For two entities with a common intersection
         the %Intersection also provides information about the geometric location
         of the intersection. Furthermore it also provides information about intersections
         of an entity with the internal or external boundaries.

         - %IntersectionIterator which is a model of Dune::IntersectionIterator
         provides access to all intersections of a given entity of codimension 0.

         - %LevelIndexSet and %LeafIndexSet which are both models of Dune::IndexSet are
         used to attach any kind of user-defined data to (subsets of) entities of the grid.
         This data is supposed to be stored in one-dimensional arrays for reasons
         of efficiency.

         - %LocalIdSet and %GlobalIdSet which are both models of Dune::IdSet are used to
         save user data during a grid refinement phase and during dynamic load balancing
         in the parallel case.

     A Grid is a container of grid entities. Given a dimension dim
     these entities have a codimension codim with 0 <= codim <= dim.

     The Grid is assumed to be hierachically refined and nested. It
     enables iteration over entities of a given level and codimension.

     The grid can be non-matching.

     All information is provided to allocate degrees of freedom in
     appropriate vector data structures (which are not part of this
     module).

     Template class Grid defines a "base class" for all grids.
